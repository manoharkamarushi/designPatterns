1. Factory pattern
There is an phone which we are building OS for it.
Open source os - android
Closed os - iOS
Old os - Symbian
others - windows

Now i will create an interface OS with method specs.
All android,ios,windows,symbian os classes implement it and adds business logic.
Create a main method, create an object for required classes with reference to Interface OS.
call the method specs, done.

But here in the main method, we are exposing the logic to the client.

Now i create a factory class, when i say open os it will gives android, 
closed - ios etc.Even if there is addition of new classes, changes. 
This factory class wont expose logic.

Now check the code.

Advantages:
1. Factory allows it subclasses to create the sub classes to choose the type of object to create.
2. It provides loose coupling.
